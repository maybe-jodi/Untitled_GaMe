# Untitled_GaMe
So, NTBeta deleted this. 

# What happened to the original!?!??!??!?!

Apparently, NTBeta no longer wanted to work on it, Bee Mario added a batch version, and AT64 is working on a Python and C++ version.)

# Is everything the same?

No, it is a bit different from the original (The batch version is still the same, however.)

# How to play?

Download the files, and run them. If you need help, contact Bee Mario, AT64, or NTBeta on discord, Mine is Bee Mario#5469, AT64's is AT64#1422, and NTBeta's is Extra sick of it#7995 or [Google](https://google.com/) it.
